### `whoami`

Hey, I'm Josh! I'm a Full Stack software engineer working at Nando's. I've been
building and maintaining software professionally for the last 5 years or so,
the first 3 in academia and then as a software developer in industry since
October 2019.

In academia I was solving all sorts of problems to do with understanding how baby
brains work, how to monitor and simulate them, and how to clean up the data we collect.
(If you want to see my publications, you should be able to find them [here](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7559-1413)).

I'm loving working in software and being able to build and work on so many great
projects and products. I'm also really passionate about trying to improve diversity
and inclusion within tech and the industry as a whole, so feel free to get in touch
with me if you want to discuss mentoring and I'll try my best to find time for it!
